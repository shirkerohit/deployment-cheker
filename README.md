# Deployment checker Demo Application

Welcome to the Deployment checker Demo Application! This React-based web app allows you to easily create, store, and retrieve release notes. The application guides you through a series of questions and generates a neatly formatted summary that you can copy and paste wherever you need. It also offers local storage functionality for convenience.

## Features

- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Go through a set of questions to detail your release notes.
- **Formatted Summary**: Receive a well-organized summary of your release notes that you can copy to your clipboard.
- **Local Storage**: Save your notes locally so you can retrieve them later without re-entering information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design to streamline the note creation process.

## React Features Used

This application utilizes several key React features to manage state and enhance functionality:

- **Component State**: 
  - The app uses local component state to manage user inputs and dynamically update the UI based on the user's responses to the questionnaire.
  - State hooks (`useState`) are employed to keep track of form data and provide real-time feedback as users fill out the questionnaire.

- **Reducers**:
  - For more complex state management, particularly when handling multiple related pieces of state, the app uses `useReducer` to manage state transitions. 
  - This pattern helps in managing actions and state updates in a more predictable manner, making it easier to handle complex state logic.
